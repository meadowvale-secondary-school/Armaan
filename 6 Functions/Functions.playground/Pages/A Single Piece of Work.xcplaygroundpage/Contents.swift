 ## A Single Piece of Work
 
 You can wrap up code that you may want to use more than once in a function. Similar to the way you *declared* the names of constants using `let`, you can declare a function using `func`.
 
 Because functions can contain multiple lines of code, the declaration is a little more complicated. Here is a very simple function:
*/
func rowTheBoat() {
    print("Row, row, row your boat")
    print("Gently down the stream")
}
rowTheBoat()
/*:
 When you've called a function in a playground, you'll see results appear in the sidebar. Calling the `rowTheBoat` function will print text in the console area below, too.

 - callout(Exercise): Write your own function that prints something to the console, then call your new function. Pay attention to the example above so that you know where all of the parentheses `()` and braces `{}` should go.
 What happens if you call your function more than once?
